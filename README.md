# Umbraco Configuration Viewer

An extension for the Umbraco backoffice that adds a new tree to the Settings section to display the resolved configuration for the runtime environment.

This will allow any user who has permission to see the Settings section to view the entire configuration for the site, which **could include sensitive connection string data**.
